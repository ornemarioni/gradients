1 - read_HESTIA_test.ipynb:
	> We have snapshots directory
	> We read the z=0 snapshot and concatenate different outputs to get position of the particles
	> 
	
2 - virial_mass.ipynb
    > We compute the virial mass of the halos.
    
3 - read_HESTIA.ipynb:
	> We have snapshots directory
	> We read the z=0 snapshot and concatenate different outputs to get position of the particles
	> We save the ten most massive halos in other outputs.
	> We plot the most massive galaxy with sphviewer.

	> Plots of mass density in stars, gas and dark matter.
